            <p>Real estate marketers can create 3D models of properties and stitch them together in a virtual reality tour, which can then be shared with potential buyers through VR headsets. This saves time and effort for both parties involved and provides a more immersive and interactive experience, which increases the likelihood of a sale.</p>
